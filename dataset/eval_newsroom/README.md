# Meta-evaluation Dataset for Newsroom

## Description
This dataset contains 60 articles with summaries generated by 7 different methods. Those system generations are annotated with human scores in terms of *coherence*, *fluency*, *informativeness*, *relevance*.

## Meta Data
* Github Repo: [lil-lab/newsroom](https://github.com/lil-lab/newsroom)
* Paper: [NEWSROOM: A Dataset of 1.3 Million Summaries with Diverse Extractive Strategies](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1065.pdf)
* Aspect: coherence, fluency, informativeness, relevance
* Language: English


## Data Structure
### Example
We collate the human judgements inside `data.json`. A data sample consists of a key and its value is shown in the following format.
```
{
  "src": "This is the source text."
  "refs": ["This is the reference summary."],
  "hypos": 
  {
    "fragments": 
    {
        "hypo": "This is the summary generatd by system fragments.",
        "scores": 
        {
            "coherence": "2.6666666666666665",
            "fluency": "3.3333333333333335",
            "informativeness": "2.6666666666666665",
            "relevance": "3.0"
        }
    },
    "textrank': 
    {
      "hypo": "This is the summary generated by system textrank.",
      "scores": 
      {
        "coherence": "4.0",
        "fluency": "4.0",
        "informativeness": "3.3333333333333335",
        "relevance": "4.0"
      }
    },
    ...
  }
} 
```

### Format
Each data sample contains the following fields:
* `src`: The tokenized, normal-cased source text.
* `refs`: The tokenized, normal-cased reference summaries.
* `hypos`: Collected system summaries together with their human judgement scores.
    * `hypo`: The tokenized, normal-cased system generated summary.
    * `scores`: (We use string scores to save space) For `data.json`, there are only human judgement scores stored as key-value dictionary here. For system output files, the automatic metric scores will also be displayed here (e.g. `{"auto-metric1": "0.2"}`).
