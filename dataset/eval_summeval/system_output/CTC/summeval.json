The researchers said say that just as antibiotics are used to make farm animals put on weight , the may also be fattening our children . Writing in the respected medical journal Pediatrics , they said that the widely-prescribed drugs could be contributing to the obesity epidemic . A third of 10-11 year olds and more than a fifth of 4-5 year olds in England are overweight or obese , leading to fears that today 's generation will be the first to die at an earlier age than their parents . Obesity : Babies given antibiotics in the first six months of life are more likely to be fat as toddlers , a large-scale study has found ( file photo ) The Finnish researchers compared the weight and height of more than 12,000 healthy two year old with records on antibiotic prescription . By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese . And children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight . Repeated prescriptions before the age of two also raised the odds of being a fat toddler . Boys seemed particularly prone weight gain after being given antibiotics . They were also slightly taller than boys who had n't been given the drugs . The study did n't prove that antibiotics were causing weight gain . But if they do , it may be because they kill of bugs in the gut that would normally feed on some of the food eaten . This frees up more food for the body . Killing certain gut bugs may also increase appetite . Lead author Dr Antti Saari , of Kuopio University Hospital , warned : 'Antibiotic exposure before six months of age , or repeatedly during infancy , was associated with increased body mass in healthy children . 'Such effects may play a role in the worldwide childhood obesity epidemic and highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics in infancy . The worldwide obesity epidemic is real , and is more pronounced for boys . 'Epidemic ' : By two years-old , one in five boys and one in ten girls was overweight or obese and children who had taken antibiotics as young babies were particularly likely to be overweight ( file photo ) 'An increase in the use of antibiotics could be an additional contributing factor to the development of excess weight problems . 'The crucial role of antibiotics in the improvement of human health is unquestionable but their extended use today has undesirable and unexpected consequences . ' Previous research has found that babies given antibiotics are at higher risk of eczema and digestive problems . The studies come amid growing concern that the over-prescription of antibiotics is leading to the pills losing their power and making common infections harder to treat . The Government has warned that a new superbug could infect up to 200,000 Britons and kill 80,000 in a single outbreak .",

Fat toddlers then lead to children having weight issues as they get older . One third of 10-11 year olds in England are overweight or obese .

The Queen 's Guard was left red-faced after he slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard - and unfortunately for him the entire incident was caught on camera . He lost his footing and slid sideways , knocking his bearskin on the side of the box and dropping his rifle . The Queen 's Guard ( pictured ) slipped on a manhole cover during the popular Changing of the Guard at Buckingham Palace last week . Unfortunately for him , the entire incident was caught on a tourist 's camera The embarrassed soldier quickly scrambled to his feet as his colleagues marched past as if nothing had happened . But the young guard started to blush as he peered at the crowd from under his bearskin and realised how many people had seen his slapstick moment . Holidaymaker David Meadwell recorded the unscheduled manouevre outside Buckingham Palace on Thursday afternoon . Mr Meadwell , 50 , from Newcastle-upon-Tyne , said : ' I was with my family for a trip to London and I thought I 'd take some pictures of the changing of the guards . Tourist David Meadwell shot this footage of the Changing of the Guard last week when the incident unfolded The moment it all started to go wrong : The guard leans heavily to the side as he appears to slip The unidentified young guard 's legs appear to get a bit tangled as he tries to turn to march away The guard , wearing full regalia , falls heavily to the floor still clutching his rifle following the slip up 'The first group changed successfully , without any problems , and so I decided to video the next group doing it . ' I did n't expect anything like this to happen - he went flying . There were quite a few people around and there were a lot of gasps as he went down .

        "src": "( CNN ) One of the biggest TV events of all time is being reimagined for new audiences . `` Roots , '' the epic miniseries about an African-American slave and his descendants , had a staggering audience of over 100 million viewers back in 1977 . Now A & E networks are remaking the miniseries , to air in 2016 . A & E , Lifetime and History ( formerly the History Channel ) announced Thursday that the three networks would simulcast a remake of the saga of Kunta Kinte , an African who was captured , shipped to America and sold into slavery to work on a Virginia plantation . LeVar Burton , who portrayed Kinte in the original , will co-executive produce the new miniseries . A press release describes the new version as `` original '' and `` contemporary '' and will draw more from Alex Haley 's classic novel , `` Roots : The Saga of an American Family . '' Producers will consult scholars in African and African-American history for added authenticity . `` We are proud to bring this saga to fans of the original , as well as to a new generation that will experience this powerful and poignant tale for the first time , '' said Dirk Hoogstra , History 's executive vice president and general manager . `` Audiences will once again feel the impact of Kunta Kinte 's indomitable spirit . '' Executive producer Mark Wolper , son of the original 's producer David L. Wolper , added , `` Kunta Kinte began telling his story over 200 years ago and that story went through his family lineage , to Alex Haley , to my father , and now the mantle rests with me . Like Kunta Kinte fought to tell his story over and over again , so must we . '' The remade `` Roots '' will encounter a new generation of viewers who have witnessed Barack Obama make history as the nation 's first African-American president and `` 12 Years a Slave '' win the Oscar for Best Picture , but also widespread racial unrest over police treatment of black suspects in many U.S. cities . `` My career began with 'Roots ' and I am proud to be a part of this new adaptation , '' said Burton . `` There is a huge audience of contemporary young Americans who do not know the story of 'Roots ' or its importance .

He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u2018 That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u2019 he told the Sunday People . \u2018 I was staggered . The younger man then came up behind me and gripped me , holding me in the chair . Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe . A police spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment \u2018 as investigations continue \u2019 .",

From Friday to Monday , a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued , according to the Italian coast guard , which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress . On Tuesday , a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing , citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast . The Italian coast guard , however , told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously , it can not confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued . An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors , nor bodies , nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized , Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said . There has been a recent upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean into Italy and an increase in rescues performed by the Italian Coast Guard to aid migrant boats . Why migrants are dying trying to reach Italy According to the International Organization for Migration , Italy registered more than 10,000 migrants arriving in the first three months of 2015 , and about 2,000 were rescued at sea during the first weekend of April in the Channel of Sicily . Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria , the IOM said . They use Libya as a country of transit . At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year , often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers , the IOM said . Sometimes the captains and crews abandon the ships , leaving passengers to fend for themselves . Last week : 978 migrants rescued in one day in Mediterranean Sea CNN 's Ralph Ellis contributed to this report .",

Three of the militants were killed by Iranian forces in the fighting Monday in the southeastern town of Negur , the state-run news agency IRNA reported . The news agency cited Ali Asghar Mirshekari , the deputy governor of Iran 's Sistan-Baluchestan province , who said the militants crossed into the country from Pakistan .

A militant group called Jaish al Adal claimed responsibility for the attack , according to Iranian state media and a Twitter account believed to be associated with the organization . According to Pakistani media , Jaish al Adal is an anti-Iranian group that has emerged during recent years in areas of Balochistan , the restive Pakistani province that borders southeastern Iran . The Sunni Muslim group has targeted Shiites and says it aims to thwart Iranian influence in Pakistan , according to the Pakistani newspaper Dawn . Jaish al Adal has also claimed responsibility for attacks on Iranian territory . One of the deadliest was in October 2013 , when 14 Iranian border guards were killed near the city of Saravan . Iranian authorities say that after similar attacks , the militants have fled back into Balochistan . `` Iran has repeatedly criticized its eastern neighbor for failing to rein in the terrorists , '' IRNA said , referring to Pakistan . The Pakistani government condemned Monday 's attack , calling it an `` act of terrorism . '' `` The concerned security agencies of Pakistan are actively investigating this incident , which took place on Iran 's territory , and have asked Iranian authorities to share with us any evidence that they have , '' the government said in a statement Wednesday .

        "src": "( CNN ) The classic video game `` Space Invaders '' was developed in Japan back in the late 1970 's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan 's corridors of power . Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

Kevin Rebbie , 56 , of Limerick Township , faces several charges , including aggravated indecent assault , unlawful contact with a minor , sexual abuse of children and invasion of privacy , the Montgomery County District Attorney 's Office said . The investigation began when a 15-year-old girl found a hidden camera under the sink in a bathroom in her Limerick Township home in March , according to prosecutors . She told investigators that Rebbie had been watching her for years when she was undressing and when he believed she was asleep . She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13 , Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her , according to Philly.com . Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom , 34 of which showed victims as they showered . Rebbie uploaded the videos , some that included close-up images of children 's genitalia , to his computer to view later , prosecutors said . The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period , according to prosecutors .

Japanese photographer Y\u00fbki Aoyama 's latest series of images capture po-faced teenagers pictured next to their fathers leaping into the air . In each picture the daughter looks directly into the camera smiling while her father pulls a dramatic pose . A series of images by photographer Y\u00fbki Aoyama sees fathers leaping into the air next to their daughters The images are from the 37-year-old 's latest book which roughly translates into Daughter and Salary Man . According to the photographer 's website the images allow the father who usually has to act serious to express his fun side by being ' a hero jumping the sky , enfold ( ing ) strong excitement and hope . ' Salary man may refer to the choice of clothing in the shoot which sees each dad in a sharply dressed suit . The images see the fathers pull energetic poses despite their age with some of the expressions of the older fathers looking slightly pained . Very little else is known about the pictures or why they have come into existence but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online for their curious nature . The 37-year-old 's images are said to be part of a book which roughly translates as Daughter and Salaryman Each image sees the daughter stood po-faced as their father makes an energetic leap Some of the older fathers adopt a pained expression as they make their jump Each photograph sees the daughter wearing casual clothing with her father in a sharp suit The pictures see the families pose in front of various Japanese landmarks Very little is known about the set of photos but they are already drumming up plenty of interest online Some of the jumps are more subtle than others with this father opting for a classic jump This young girl ca n't help but giggle at her dad 's ambitious leap This dapper dad adds a peace gesture into his final pose This father ca n't help but jump for joy in his portrait",

Kaitlyn Granado , 24 , a teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , was first arrested on March 19 for having an inappropriate relationship with a 15-year-old student , and was released on bail . Now she has been arrested again after another pupil , also aged 15 , also accused Granado of having sex with him on two consecutive nights in January this year . According to the affidavit , seen by the Star-Telegram , the teen claims the sexual relationship took place in her car late at night on January 18 and 19 across the road from another school in Dallas . The abuse came to light after a school police officer learned of a possible relationship between Granado and one of the boys last month . She was arrested on March 19 , and in a police interview she admitted kissing the pupil and allowing him to touch her breasts in April the previous year , according to the Dallas Morning News . She was subsequently suspended from teaching and put on administrative leave by school officials . At the time , detectives said they did n't think she had been in a relationship with any other pupils , but just days later , on March 24 , officers quizzed a second boy about a possible relationship with her . A spokesman for the police department said : 'There was some discussion , some rumoring , there may have been a second person involved . 'That information came from within the school , and it turned out to be true . ' Granado , who is a maths teacher at MacArthur High School in Irving , Texas ( pictured ) , was also arrested last month when she admitted kissing another boy , also 15 , and lettin him touch her breasts Granado was booked into Irving County Jail for the second time on Monday , and released after posting a $ 50,000 bail . It is not known how Granado intends to plead to the second set of charges against her . A spokesman for Irving school district said : 'While privacy laws prevent us from sharing specific details , we can reassure our families that we took immediate and appropriate action . 'Being on administrative leave prevents her from working with students and being present on any Irving ISD property . '",

New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when the attack happened and described how 'the crocodile kept the dog in its mouth for ages , not moving at all ' . Mr Weston told Daily Mail Australia the dog belonged to the local bike shop 's owner . Scroll down for video The large croc proudly held on to its catch for hours as it lurked around the Puerto Vallarta marina , in Mexico 'There 's a sanctuary for these crocodiles up the river ( 200m away ) which runs out to the sea and the marina , ' Mr Weston explained . 'The dog went to the water 's edge to see the crocodile ( being curious I guess ) but things did n't go according to plan obviously . 'It was certainly a shock to the system . Guess that 's nature though , ' he said . In the video the beast glides through the water , with rocks on one side and a footpath on the other , as crowds gasp in amazement . New Zealander Tim Weston was on holiday in Puerto Vallarta with his wife when he saw the alarming sight Tourist Tim Weston took a photo of the crocodile with the dog between its jaws A video of the crocodile swimming through the marina with the bike shop owner 's dog has been viewed more than 500,000 times Mr Weston said : ' A couple of hours later we walked back past and there was still a crowd ... But we did n't want to look at it again as we had just eaten . Yesterday morning there was no sign of either . ' Social media users have reacted in horror to the video that was posted on the Bogged Facebook page . One woman called the video 'horrible ' and another said ' I hate crocodiles now ' . But crocodiles are a common site in Puerto Vallarta as the Mexican beach resort is built amongst the mangroves that the creatures have called home for centuries . As well as living in the nearby sanctuary , crocs are regularly spotted on the resort 's golf course . In Mexico the 'American Crocodiles ' can reach lengths of 6 meters and as a result of urbanisation are living closer to humans than ever before . One social media user called the video 'horrible ' and another said ' I hate crocodiles now '",

At the start of the campaign Bruce was targeting 10 wins to survive , but despite a strong start his Hull side have mustered just six and he is hoping 'nine or eight might be enough . ' Hull were the better side against Southampton for the first 45 minutes but a James Ward-Prowse penalty and late strike from Graziano Pelle meant they left with nothing . Steve Bruce is confident he can keep Hull City in the Premier League this season and avoid relegation They now have six games to save their season including nightmare fixtures against Liverpool , Arsenal , Tottenham and Manchester United . But Bruce insisted : 'Everyone is up for the challenge and I 'm sure and convinced that we 'll do it . If we keep remaining positive I 'm convinced we can take a couple of results which will take us over the line . 'We 've had a wonderful three years near enough from getting promoted to getting to a cup final , staying up last year . I 've always had something in my water that this season would be the most difficult because all of a sudden you 've created an expectation and unfortunately we have n't been able to live up to that expectation . Hull were beaten 2-0 by Southampton on Saturday and are just two points clear of the drop zone 'We 've got our reasons for it , we 've still got enough to keep us out of trouble I hope . We 're bang in it but I 'm still convinced we 'll get out of it . ' Bruce puts their struggles down to several long-term injuries to key players . At St Mary 's Stadium , Mohamed Diame returned from five months out and James Chester from three . Michael Dawson and Nikica Jelavic have missed half the season and Robert Snodgrass has not been available at all . Bruce added : 'They are big players for us and unfortunately , at this moment , we have n't been able to cope . We 've battled on manfully but not quite been good enough . ' James Ward-Prowse slots home a penalty for Southampton against Hull as they moved up to fifth Ronald Koeman 's side moved to fifth in the table ahead of Tottenham , who lost to Aston Villa , and Liverpool , who play Newcastle on Monday . But the Dutchman left with his own problems , after he had to intervene when Sadio Mane tried to take the penalty when Ward-Prowse was first-choice . Koeman will speak to his squad to remind them that team rules can not be broken by anyone . Koeman said : ' I already had a word with Mane but we will talk to the team about that because maybe I have to mention it a bit more clearly . '",

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds , which assess English , maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury , Gloucestershire . This was despite the exam session finishing , a conduct panel heard . Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u2019 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u2019 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u2019 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction . 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions . ' He was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court .",

No love : 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $ 300,000 to $ 600,000 , but received no bids at a Sotheby 's auction Wednesday The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted ' a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City . ' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the Bronx since 1976 , the year before Jackson joined the team . ESPN reports Jackson , who attended the auction , bought the letters 'on a lark . ' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters , some of which are also 10-feet-wide , he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself .

He said : \u2018 It is understanding that when you are a professional , elite sportsperson , there are things you can and can not be doing and be seen to be doing . \u2018 It \u2019 s not just for your welfare but also because of your responsibilities . \u2018 It is difficult . Some of these young guys are doing what you would consider to be normal things \u2014 and I \u2019 m not talking about this instance \u2014 ( but ) how it gets framed is totally different. \u2019 Rodgers would not discuss whether he would give Gerrard , available after a three-match suspension , an immediate recall against Villa , making it clear that his sole priority is steering Liverpool into their first FA Cup final of his reign . They fell short in the title race last season and then faltered in the last four of the Capital One Cup in January , but Rodgers thinks they are ready to progress . Reds have captain Steven Gerrard ( centre ) back for their FA Cup semi after serving a three-match suspension \u2018 When you get so close , whether it was in the title race or the cup , it hurts , \u2019 said Rodgers . \u2018 Trace back the winners in sport . If you look at everything they have won , also look at what they have lost . You will see that they go close on a number of occasions before they step on . \u2018 Look at players who have won Champions Leagues and you trace back and see they have also lost Champions League semi-finals and finals . It \u2019 s all part of the journey \u2014 losing but taking that forward and improving you. \u2019 Rodgers ( left ) has n't revealed whether he 'll recall Gerrard for Sunday 's clash against Aston Villa at Wembley",

        "src": "Nathan Hughes on Friday night had his ban for accidentally knocking out George North sensationally over-turned on appeal , following an outcry on his behalf . The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been \u2018 reckless \u2019 for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion , as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing . Yet , in a stunning twist \u2013 and in light of fierce criticism \u2013 the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held . Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin \u2019 s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence . Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club . Captain James Haskell said : \u2018 Astounded would be an under-statement \u2019 , while fly-half Andy Goode added : \u2018 Really can \u2019 t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes . There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome. \u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018 total joke \u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an \u2018 absolute joke \u2019 . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club \u2019 s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing . He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps \u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 . Jeremy Summers , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : \u2018 The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh . Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally . \u2019",

        "src": "( CNN ) A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday . The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan 's eye . He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport . The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia . `` The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' Durken said . The fires were started in southeastern Siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . But on April 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV . As a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . Rescue crews were able to put out the flames . However , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest . Parts of Oregon , Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , KOMO-TV said . That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye . As the smoke starts to dissipate , air quality will get better and these fiery sunsets will lose their reddish hue .",

            "Smoke from massive fires in Siberia created fiery sunsets in the Pacific Northwest . Atmospheric winds carried smoke from the wildfires across the Pacific Ocean . Smoke particles altered wavelengths from the sun , creating a more intense color .",
            "A person is looking beyond their location at a region of fire burning villages . Although the color was beautiful to see , the air quality and site was tough .",
            "Residents in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia have recently been treated to uniquely intense red sunsets . These sunsets are the result of large quantities of smoke drifting across the Pacific Ocean , that is originating from out-of-control wildfires in Southeastern Siberia , on account of fires started by Siberian farmers .",

            "A fire in Southern Siberia was started by farmers simply using their fields to burn grass strong winds caught the blaze and helped it grow quickly . The smoke particles filter out short wavelength colors , so instead of seeing a normal sunset with greens and blues , you get an intense red . Many states in the US are experiencing the intense red sunsets , including parts of Oregon , Washington , and British Columbia .",
            "A fire started in Siberia by a group of farmers caused people to see deep red sunsets in Oregon and Washington . The sunset is the results of the smoke filtering out the green , blue , yellow and purple from the sunlight .",

            "Southern Siberian fires started by local farmers burning their field grasses have created bright red sunsets in the Pacific Northwest , including Washington , Oregon , and British Columbia in Canada .

For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series . FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21 . On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the On the evidence of this entertaining 90 minutes high on skill and commitment , there are talents on both sides that may well deserve their chance in the coming years .",

Last week , Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found guilty on all 30 charges he faced related to the bombings at the 2013 race and the dramatic violence that dragged out for days afterward . A look at all of the charges The sentencing phase begins Tuesday , a day after this year 's edition of the landmark race . It is expected to last four weeks . The 13th Juror : Now it gets real In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe , Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son , Martin . Their daughter , Jane , also was severely injured . `` Our family has grieved , buried our young son , battled injuries , and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same , '' they said in the Globe column titled `` To end the anguish , drop the death penalty . '' `` We sat in the courtroom , day after day , bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs , replicated bombs , and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive . '' They said they understood the `` heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed . '' `` We were there . We lived it . The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son , maimed our 7-year-old daughter , and stole part of our soul . '' But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close . `` We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal , '' they wrote . They go on to say : `` We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives . We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering , painful reminder of what the defendant took from them , which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring . '' Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15 , 2013 . Tsarnaev was convicted last week , while his brother , Tamerlan , was killed in a shootout with police two years ago . The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name . They stress that they were only speaking for themselves when they argue against the death penalty . `` We believe that now is the time to turn the page , end the anguish , and look toward a better future -- for us , for Boston , and for the country , '' they wrote .",

The custom-built Boeing 747 is believed to have cost its ultra-wealthy owner \u00a3400million after it was customised to fit his specifications exactly over a three-year period . The jumbo jet would normally carry as many as 600 passengers - but this version was built for just a single tycoon , although he will be able to fit dozens of guests . It contains a large dining room where travellers can enjoy meals cooked in an adjoining kitchen , with a lounge and 'state room ' at the back of the plane . More sleeping space is provided in the 'aeroloft ' on the top deck of the vessel , with eight full beds for passengers who prefer to get some shut-eye on flights . Luxury : This is the lounge on board a custom-built Boeing 747-8 , as depicted in an artist 's impression by Greenpoint Technologies Shuteye : The master bedroom of the \u00a3400million plane has a huge bed as well as an armchair and sofa for when the owner needs to relax Business : The conference room of the plane could be perfect for meetings in the sky with its long table in the centre Chill-out : The lounge decor looks like a luxury hotel , belying its true location inside a plane similar to those used by commercial airlines Executive : This room , which can be used as an office or a guest bedroom , gives a hint to its true location thanks to the porthole-style windows Kicking back : The main suite could easily be mistaken for a room in a top hotel thanks to its over-the-top decorations Restaurant : The central portion of the plane hosts a dining room which is attached to a kitchen , allowing the owner to make use of the services of a private chef Shiny : The jumbo jet is one of the most luxurious private planes ever built , with the price tag believed to have reached a total of \u00a3400million Sofa : Parts of the plane are set aside for guests to relax while watching television , as the vessel can carry several dozen passengers Plush : Another artist 's impression of the main state room , which also contains a desk so the owner can switch between work and relaxation Welcoming : Images of the lounge show a space very different to the normal aeroplane cabin , with the traditional rows of seats completely discarded in favour of a hotel-like ambience Exclusive : Few people can ever imagine flying in this sort of luxury - far more glitzy than first class on commercial flights Plan : The layout of the Boeing 747 is shown in this plan published by Greenpoint Technologies Gigantic : The luxury interior has been built inside a Boeing 747-8 similar to this one , which can hold up to 600 passengers",

That was the easy part . In a difficult bid to land a rocket stage on a floating barge for the first time , the private space exploration company was unsuccessful . SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted : `` Ascent successful . Dragon enroute to Space Station . Rocket landed on droneship , but too hard for survival . '' He later clarified that the rocket landed , but tipped over . SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded . SpaceX has said it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground . Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth 's atmosphere or , like NASA 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean . So why try to land one ? Musk wants to cut costs . On his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to `` reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred . '' What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon ? The smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth 's atmosphere . The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and ISSpresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon . They 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to Earth . When they 're done , Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California . This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station . The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station . Tuesday 's launch was the second attempt for this mission . Monday 's planned launch was scrubbed due to weather . CNN 's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .",

Miralem Pjanic finished off a swift counter-attack for Roma in the 25th minute and goalkeeper Morgan de Sanctis did the rest - saving shot after shot by Napoli in the second half . 'It 's important to win a match and gain some continuity , ' De Sanctis said . 'The last ( four ) months were tough in terms of results . So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride . ' Miralem Pjanic slots home to put Roma ahead in the 25th minute after a clinical counter-attack Pjanic ( second left ) celebrates with his team-mates Juan Iturbe , and Daniele de Rossi after scoring Second-place Roma moved provisionally four points ahead of city rivals Lazio , who play later on Saturday . They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30 . Meanwhile , Napoli 's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches , and Diego Maradona 's former club remained fifth . Security was tight for Napoli 's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season 's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico . Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis ( right ) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order . But there were no reports of problems . Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post . A few minutes later , Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi , who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in . Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma , who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there was n't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli , who officiated last year 's World Cup final . In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th . Iturbe had a chance to make it 2-0 two minutes from time but hit the outside of the net . Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne came on late for his first action since tearing his knee in November .",

But that doesn \u2019 t prevent one man from dipping his hand in the fish tank and giving his blood parrot cichlid a stroke . Capturing his remarkable relationship on camera , Roland Giroux gently cups the fish with his hand from within side the tank and then treats it to a massage . The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man \u2019 s fingers . The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation . Repeating the process , the fish swims off once more before immediately returning to the man \u2019 s hand to be stroked again . Later in the video the fish interacts further with the man by swimming up his arm and circling his fingers . The man places his hand into the tank and gently cups the blood parrot cichlid with his fingers Before burying its face into his hand and remaining very still once more . The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn \u2019 t play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day . The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid of the midas and the redhead cichlid and was first bred in Taiwan around 1986 .",

When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said : \u2018 Mind that locker , Stokesey. \u2019 It was here , of course , that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team . Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes ( left ) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs . I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination . He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u2019 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u2019 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u2019 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets . Stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes ( left ) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally . There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible . This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game . They can only get better and that \u2019 s an exciting prospect .",

        "src": "( CNN ) ISIS on Wednesday released more than 200 Yazidis , a minority group whose members were killed , captured and displaced when the Islamist terror organization overtook their towns in northern Iraq last summer , officials said . Most of those released were women and children ; the rest were ill or elderly , said Rassol Omar , a commander in the Peshmerga force that defends northern Iraq 's semi-autonomous Kurdish region . Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government . It was n't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday 's release , Osman said . Osman said 217 Yazidis were released . Omar , the Peshmerga commander , had a higher count : 228 . ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year . The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes . Yazidis are of Kurdish descent , and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity , Judaism and Zoroastrianism . One of the oldest religious communities in the world , the Yazidis have long suffered persecution , with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers . ISIS ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary . ISIS ' conquest of the town of Sinjar , in particular , provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria . ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds , Yian Dakhil , the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq 's Parliament , told CNN last year . Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives . An international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains . Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population . CNN 's Raja Razek reported from Beirut . CNN 's Jason Hanna wrote from Atlanta . CNN 's Hamdi Alkshali , Faith Karimi and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report .",

James Hayward had arrived at East Midlands Airport with his parents , Phil , 44 , and Hazel , 38 , with his brightly coloured toy - which fires sponge darts - packed in his hand luggage for their flight out to Lanzarote . But security officers , who were described as 'over-zealous ' by the boy 's father , then took exception to James 's harmless toy when it was picked up on the system 's X-ray machines . They demanded he hand it over , and they also performed a thorough patting down and inspection of the primary school child . Dad Phil has labelled the security checks 'ludicrous ' and criticized how staff reacted in the situation . Mr Hayward , a software engineer , said : 'Fair enough they are thorough but it just seemed a bit ludicrous to take a plastic gun away from a four-year-old . 'We were so late by this point I did n't have time to stop and argue with them so we just had to leave it because we did n't want to miss our flight . ' I explained to James we would get him a new one when we got back from our holiday . We were going for 10 days in Lanzarote over Easter . ' I thought it was a bit over-zealous of the security staff considering how many people were trying to get through at the time . 'No wonder it was taking so long if they wanted to pat down every little kid . Scroll down for video After returning from the holiday to Lanzarote , the four-year-old boy was bought a replacement toy gun The smile is back on James Hayward 's face following the confiscation of his toy gun at East Midlands Airport The \u00a36 plastic gadget was described as a semi-automatic soft dart gun by its manufacturers , and James was bought a new one off eBay when the family returned from their holidays .

Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports . According to the newspaper , the five former Three Lions bosses warn the English game will suffer if it blocks the proposals from Dyke and the FA 's England Commission . 'We urge everyone in the English game to get behind them as quickly as possible , ' the letter reportedly says . It adds : 'Failure to do so risks England falling further behind the leading football nations and will only make it harder to end the long wait to win the World Cup . ' Former England managers ( clockwise ) Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Steve McClaren and Sven-Goran Eriksson have backed Dyke 's call Only 81 of the 220 Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection - a fairly pitiful 36.8 per cent . The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason . 'With promising players such as ( Ross ) Barkley , ( Raheem ) Sterling and ( Harry ) Kane starting to break through , it is clear we can still produce top young talent , ' they write . 'The one thing they are not being offered is the most important of all : opportunity . '",

The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

            "A record for the longest distance migration of a mammal was shattered recently by a north pacific gray whale . The whale made a trip of 14,000 miles .",
            "The longest mammalian migration was just recorded by a pacific gray whale . It swam over 14,000 miles in the process . There are only about 150 gray whales known .",
            "Varvara , a North Pacific whale , has earned herself a place records books . She completed the longest migration ever recorded by people , making an almost 14,000 mile journey according to Oregon State University , who helped with the tracking .",
            "A north pacific gray whale has completed the longest mammal migration ever recorded , a staggering 14,000 miles , ending up near Mexico . This inclination to travel thus indicates that she might not be a western whale , as thought , but an eastern gray . The gray whale shattered the previous record , set by a humpback that traveled a measly 10,190 miles .",
            "A new whale has been discovered as the longest mammal in history . A biologist explored various areas to learn about this mammal and learned that it comes from Mexico .",
            "A north pacific gray whale named varvara just recorded the longest migration ever after it swam 14,000 miles according to Oregon State University , who helped with the study . She 's believed to be from Mexico as her swim took her there from russia to mexico . The long migration calls into question the genetic differentiation that scientists believed existed between western gray whales and eastern gray whales .",
            "Scientists from Oregon State University helped conduct a study to track whale migration . During the study , they discovered a whale named Varvara , who swam almost 14,000 miles . She swam from Russia , through the pacific ocean to the west coast of the United States , and then to Baja , Mexico . There is strong evidence that Mexico is where she is originally from . At first they thought she was a western whale , who are endangered , but her ability to navigate long distances led the scientists to believe that she is actually an Eastern gray . They believe there are only 150 western gray whales in existence .",
            "A north gray whale by the name of Vavara left Sakhalin Island on a long mating journey . The journey was watched by researchers at Oregon State University . The distance of their journey and their genetic differences are dependent on whether the grey whales are from the north or from the south .",
            "A whale-tracking study , conducted by scientists at Oregon State University , followed a gray whale named Varvara to Mexico , where she is believed to be from . Scientists have had difficulty identifying the differences between western gray whale and eastern gray whales , although there is genetic differentiation between them .",
            "Oregon State University was involved with the study Varvara is thought to be from just off the Sakhalin Island in Russia The two specied being looked at were Western Gray Whales and Eastern Grays"

Scroll down for video Surprise ! A man stands on a clump of land that emerged overnight along the coastline of Shiretoko Peninsula near Rausu , on Hokkaido Island , Japan 'An aerial survey indicates that the land swell happened as a result of a landslide ' , local researcher Yoshinori Yajima told the Hokkaido Shimbun newspaper after he flew over the area Monday . The mass , which has risen some 30 to 50ft above sea level , measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long , and 100ft wide , a town official said . The new stretch of land came as a complete surprise to the locals , as there was no indication of the land movement overnight 'The local residents said they did n't hear any sounds and there were no tremors ( when the land appeared ) , ' said Katsuhiro Tanaka , the president of the Rausu Fisheries Cooperative Association , who viewed the expanded coastline the day it was discovered . The mass , which has risen some 50ft above sea level , measures roughly 1,000- 1,640ft long , and 100ft wide No clue : Local residents on Hokkaido island say they felt no tremors overnight , or heard any sounds to indicate movement , and that the landmass just appeared New view : Local residents from Rausu , Hokkaido , take a look at the newly emerged coastline Authorities have not been able to determine exactly when the landslide hit the snow-covered coastline , but they do not expect it to expand further , said an official at the central government 's Hokkaido Regional Development Bureau . 'Our understanding is that this is different from earthquakes , ' he told AFP . It is not believed to be related to the 7.8magnitude earthquake that struck the Kathmandu Valley on Saturday , which so far has claimed more than 4,000 lives .

Arsenal playmaker Mesut Ozil can now countdown the minutes until the 4pm encounter on Sunday with his brand new Apple Watch . The 26-year-old was the beneficiary of the timepiece - which ranges in price from \u00a3299 to \u00a313,500 - as he visited an Apple store on Thursday afternoon . Arsenal midfielder Mesut Ozil ( right ) took to Instagram to show off his new Apple Watch on Thursday Ozil compared his watch to TV character Michael Knight in the hit action show Knight Rider Ozil took to Instagram to share his joy at his latest gift , comparing his gadget to former TV character Michael Knight from the hit action show Knight Rider . Accompanied with the caption : 'Excited about my new cool gadget ! It 's just like Michael Knight 's watch , but a real one # knightrider # phone , ' Ozil appears in awe of the device - which will be released on general sale on Friday . The midfielder , who has scored four goals in 25 matches for the Gunners in all competitions this season , is expected to start for Arsene Wenger 's side at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Arsenal trail the Blues by 10 points with six league games remaining - but have been boosted by the return of Jack Wilshere . Wilshere was on the bench in their FA Cup semi-final win over Reading at Wembley on April 18 after five months out through injury . And club legend Ray Parlour believes that the 23-year-old \u2019 s fitness record is the one thing holding him back from reaching his undoubted potential in the Arsenal midfield . \u2018 I think he \u2019 s the future of the club , \u2019 said Parlour . \u2018 I think if he stays fit , he \u2019 s a quality player , there \u2019 s no doubt about that . Jack Wilshere ( centre ) was on the bench for Arsenal 's FA Cup semi-final against Reading Ray Parlour , who won three championships with Arsenal , has backed Wilshere to be the future of the club \u2018 The way he goes past players , the way he links up with people , I definitely think he \u2019 s got a big role to play . \u2018 But again , the big question mark is can he stay fit ? Look at Abou Diaby . Diaby \u2019 s a terrific player . But look at him , the injuries the last few years . \u2018 The big burning question is can Wilshere have a full season without being injured for a long period , like he hasn \u2019 t had for the last three or four seasons. \u2019 Wilshere , the England international , is pictured in training for Arsenal at London Colney last week",

The champion 's shock 2-1 loss to Crystal Palace on Monday saw United move a point above their local rivals to add extra incentive for both sides ahead of the derby at Old Trafford , which could ultimately decide who finishes second behind expected winners Chelsea . While Manuel Pellegrini 's side have struggled since the turn of the year , turning from title challengers to fourth place chases , United are coasting on confidence having won their last five consecutive league games . Clattenburg will be joined on Sunday by assistants Simon Beck and Jake Collin , while Jonathan Moss will serve as the fourth official .

        "src": "( CNN ) After a Russian fighter jet intercepted a U.S. reconnaissance plane in an `` unsafe and unprofessional manner '' earlier this week , the United States is complaining to Moscow about the incident . On Tuesday , a U.S. RC-135U was flying over the Baltic Sea when it was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker . The Pentagon said the incident occurred in international airspace north of Poland . The U.S. crew believed the Russian pilot 's actions were `` unsafe and unprofessional due to the aggressive maneuvers it performed in close proximity to their aircraft and its high rate of speed , '' Pentagon spokesman Mark Wright said . Russian state news agency Sputnik reported the U.S. plane was flying toward the Russian border with its transponder switched off , according to a Defense Ministry spokesman . Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said the Russian jet flew around the U.S. plane several times to identify it and get its tail number . An official with the U.S. European Command said the claim that the transponder was off was false . Wright said the Pentagon and State Department will `` file the appropriate petition through diplomatic channels '' with Russia . This is not the first time the U.S. has complained about an incident involving a RC-135U and a SU-27 . A year ago , a Russian jet flew within 100 feet of a RC-135U over the Sea of Okhotsk in the western Pacific , according to U.S. officials who called it `` one of the most dangerous close passes in decades . '' The Pentagon complained to the Russia military about that incident . Russian and U.S. aircraft often encounter each other , both in Northern Europe as well as the area between the Russian Far East and Alaska . CNN 's Steve Brusk and Jamie Crawford contributed to this report .",

The gun was inside a hard rifle case and was 'secured properly ' to a truck safe with padlocks and chains while the car was parked at the Marriott Springhill Suites , according to police . Police believe the thief stole the rifle by breaking the rear right passenger-side window , tying a rope around the rifle case 's handle or a cable lock , and using the momentum from another vehicle to then break the case 's handle free from the lock . The window frame of the agent 's car was pulled from the door , which police believe could indicate the large case was ripped through the shattered window . 'The rifle had been secured properly , ' Salt Lake City Police Detective Dennis McGowan told Fox 13 Salt Lake City . 'There are all kinds of ways the weapon was secure . Yet someone was able to forcefully take the weapon . ' The FBI agent also reported that his gear bag , backpack , and some clothing and tools were also stolen during the March 27 theft , which the police report states happened overnight .

Chelsea defender John Terry comes in from behind with a strong challenge on Radamel Falcao Terry 's challenge on Falcao came during the build-up to Eden Hazard 's opening goal for Chelsea The Manchester United striker struggles to hold his grand and loses the ball to Terry near the half-way line Terry 's strong challenge leads to a loose ball that is picked up by Cesc Fabregas to start of the scoring move Without taking anything away from the sublime spectacle of the goal , pundits Thierry Henry , Jamie Redknapp and Graeme Souness agreed during their half-time analysis that play should have been stopped for Terry 's rough tackle on Falcao . Souness said , 'It 's a decent forearm smash . I mean he does stick his elbow in the back of Falcao 's head and that 's a foul . ' He added , 'If that elbow 's not there he 's not going down like that . ' Former Arsenal captain Henry , meanwhile , felt sympathy for Falcao as a fellow striker . Asked if he would have wanted a foul in that position as a player , the Frenchman responded , 'Yes , all day long . ' Finally , Redknapp admitted that while Falcao could have possibly done better to stay on his feet , Terry 's challenge from behind should n't have gone unpunished . ' I think he could have been stronger , but it 's still a foul . ' Sky pundits Graeme Souness ( left ) , Thierry Henry ( centre ) and Jamie Redknapp agree Terry fouled Falcao",

But one Scottish scientist is hoping they could , in fact , be the answer to heating our homes in the future . However , he has n't ruled out the chance of someone could potentially use them for weapons . Space lasers : Dr Adrian Quarterman has suggested space lasers could be used to power homes in the future - but says the beams will be nowhere near as powerful as imagined in films like Star Wars ( pictured ) Dr Adrian Quarterman , of Dundee University , is working on a laser which will convert sun beams into energy , The Times reported . The satellites will orbit the earth , covered in mirrors to help it harvest the sunlight and convert it into laser light . The energy it then creates , using semi-conductors , can be shot back down to earth . If it works , it could mean solar power could even become viable in Scotland , or be able to restore power instantly to disaster hit areas . The physicist told The Times : 'What this will do is be able to fire at solar panels to boost the energy they are receiving . ' Initial trials in Scotland were successful , but Dr Quarterman is now hoping to move the trials to Portugal . Similar ? : Tokyo rresearchers have proposed a laser system to attach to the ISS which would be used to shoot down pieces of debris in Earth orbit ( artist 's illustration shown ) Unlike the lasers in the movies , however , they will not be powerful enough to blind a pigeon , let alone blow up a planet . And it is quite different from ideas unveiled in a paper earlier this week , which could see the International Space Station fitted with lasers to clear up 'space junk ' . The system , suggested by researchers at the Riken research institute in Tokyo , would use a telescope already mounted on the station to find and target pieces of debris up to 62 miles ( 100km ) away . Powerful pulses from the laser would then push space junk into Earth \u2019 s atmosphere , where it would burn up . But this laser would also not be powerful enough to be turned into a weapon : the pieces it targets will be less than a centimetre in size . However , Dr Quarterman has acknowledged you 'might possibly have to worry a bit about who is in control ' of his satellites .",

Stephen Munden , 54 , described as having a 'fanatical obsession ' with small girls after he targeted a toddler on a bus , has been missing since 6.15pm on Tuesday and was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire . Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls . ' A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties . He added that Munden had difficulty controlling his sexual interest in small children but the girl on the bus was probably unaware of his intentions . Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order . Detective Chief Inspector Tim Rowlandson said : 'We are extremely keen to hear from anyone who has seen this man since yesterday evening or knows where he might be . 'Mr Munden is subject to a hospital order after being convicted and sentenced for sexual offences and also suffers from learning difficulties , so we need to know where he is as a matter of urgency .

Stiviano to pay back more than $ 2.6 million in gifts after Sterling 's wife sued her . In the lawsuit , Rochelle `` Shelly '' Sterling accused Stiviano of targeting extremely wealthy older men . She claimed Donald Sterling used the couple 's money to buy Stiviano a Ferrari , two Bentleys and a Range Rover , and that he helped her get a $ 1.8 million duplex . Who is V. Stiviano ? Stiviano countered that there was nothing wrong with Donald Sterling giving her gifts and that she never took advantage of the former Los Angeles Clippers owner , who made much of his fortune in real estate . Shelly Sterling was thrilled with the court decision Tuesday , her lawyer told CNN affiliate KABC . `` This is a victory for the Sterling family in recovering the $ 2,630,000 that Donald lavished on a conniving mistress , '' attorney Pierce O'Donnell said in a statement . `` It also sets a precedent that the injured spouse can recover damages from the recipient of these ill-begotten gifts .

According to the Los Angeles Times , the list also includes a $ 391 Easter bunny costume , a $ 299 two-speed blender and a $ 12 lace thong . Donald Sterling 's downfall came after an audio recording surfaced of the octogenarian arguing with Stiviano . In the tape , Sterling chastises Stiviano for posting pictures on social media of her posing with African-Americans , including basketball legend Magic Johnson . `` In your lousy f**ing Instagrams , you do n't have to have yourself with -- walking with black people , '' Sterling said in the audio first posted by TMZ . He also tells Stiviano not to bring Johnson to Clippers games and not to post photos with the Hall of Famer so Sterling 's friends can see . `` Admire him , bring him here , feed him , f**k him , but do n't put ( Magic ) on an Instagram for the world to have to see so they have to call me , '' Sterling said .

At the same time , managers at the passport agency , which made a \u00a342 million profit during the chaos , received up to \u00a33,500 in bonuses . Ministers refused to give a blanket refund to the desperate families who had to pay extra to get their travel documents rushed through , and even to some who missed out on trips . Scroll down for video The boxes of passport applications piled up at in office in Liverpool at the peak of the backlog last summer Keith Vaz , who as chairman of the Home Affairs Committee led the calls for compensation , said last night : \u2018 I am astonished so few people have been given compensation for what was a fiasco presided over by the management of the passport office , especially as they made a profit last year that ran into millions of pounds. \u2019 The problems began a year ago as HM Passport Office struggled to cope with 3.6 million Britons applying for documents . By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra \u00a330 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time . Details obtained by The Mail on Sunday show scarcely any of the thousands of holidaymakers caught up in the chaos ever got anything back from the Passport Office . In total just 2,191 compensation applications were approved between April last year and January this year , scarcely changed from 2,077 for the previous year . The total paid out was \u00a3203,066 , giving an average sum of \u00a392.68 . The biggest single payout was \u00a35,463 ; the lowest \u00a31 . The Passport Office said it could not say how many claims were rejected , partly because of \u2018 the system failure of our customer complaint database \u2019 . It can be revealed however that Ministers rejected a demand by the Home Affairs Select Committee for all those left out of pocket to be compensated , saying : \u2018 It would create a precedent. \u2019 Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz led the calls for compensation and was 'astonished ' to learn just 2,191 compensation applications were approved This newspaper contacted more than a dozen holidaymakers who had either missed trips or had to pay extra to get passports in time . Only one had got money back . Among those refused were Mathew Bean and Hayley Kirkham . They lost close to \u00a31,500 on a trip to Morocco , where he had planned to propose , because their passports did not arrive in time \u2013 even though they had applied ten weeks before they were due to travel and paid for upgrades . HM Passport Office made a surplus of \u00a342.3 million between April and October last year . In 2013-14 , the most recent figures available , managers were handed a total of \u00a31.8 million in bonuses , with the average reward \u00a3499 and the highest \u00a33,500 .",
