{"src": "( CNN ) The classic video game `` Space Invaders '' was developed in Japan back in the late 1970 's -- and now their real-life counterparts are the topic of an earnest political discussion in Japan 's corridors of power . Luckily , Japanese can sleep soundly in their beds tonight as the government 's top military official earnestly revealed that the country 's Air Self Defense Force ( ASDF ) had never encountered an extraterrestrial unidentified flying object . Responding to a query from flamboyant former wrestler-turned-lawmaker Antonio Inoki , Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told the Diet , Japan 's parliament , that his jets had , to date , never come across any UFOs from outer space . `` When the Air Self Defense Force detects indications of an unidentified flying object that could violate our country 's airspace , it scrambles fighter jets if necessary and makes visual observation , '' Nakatani said . He continued : `` They sometimes find birds or flying objects other than aircraft but I do n't know of a case of finding an unidentified flying object believed to have come over from anywhere other than Earth . '' Inoki has appeared in the U.S.-based WWE -- which describes him as `` among the most respected men in sports-entertainment '' -- and is the founder of the New Japan Pro Wrestling organization . He entered Japan 's Upper House for a second stint in politics in 2013 . He also famously fought Muhammad Ali in 1976 , in one of the first-ever mixed-discipline matches , which would later pave the way for today 's wildly popular Mixed Martial Arts contests . Before his return to politics he was a regular fixture on Japanese TV variety shows and has promoted a slew of products , from hot sauce to banks . The maverick politician also traveled to Iraq in 1990 to try to secure the release of Japanese hostages , and has more recently attempted to replicate former NBA star Dennis Rodman 's `` basketball diplomacy '' by staging a wrestling tournament in North Korea . He reportedly converted to Islam in the 1990s , although he says he practices both Islam and Buddhism . The lawmaker , who is universally known in Japan for his colossal chin and once-ever-present red scarf -- these days often replaced with a red necktie -- as much as for his political achievements , had asked a Upper House Budget Committee meeting if aircraft were ever scrambled to meet extraterrestrial threats , and if research was being done into alien visitors , prompting Nakatani 's response . Inoki also claims to have seen a UFO with his own eyes , but admitted that he did n't know personally if aliens existed . The exchange was n't the first time Japanese politicians have discussed the implications of visitors from another planet . In 2007 then-Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba pondered the legal ramifications , under Japan 's pacifist constitution , of a defense against an invasion from outer space .

The Wasps No 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been â€˜ reckless â€™ for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the Welsh Lion , as he scored a try for Northampton on March 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Although it was accepted that there had been no intent , the Fiji-born player with England ambitions received a further sanction at the original hearing . Yet , in a stunning twist â€“ and in light of fierce criticism â€“ the ban was thrown out , as the appeal lodged by Wasps was up-held . Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin â€™ s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence .

There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome. â€™ Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a â€˜ total joke â€™ and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an â€˜ absolute joke â€™ .

He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps â€™ Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 .

{"src": "( CNN ) A fiery sunset greeted people in Washington Sunday . The deep reddish color caught Seattle native Tim Durkan 's eye . He photographed a handful of aerial shots of the sunset warming the city 's skyline and shared them on CNN iReport . The stunning sunsets were the result of raging wildfires in parts of Siberia . `` The dramatic sunsets began showing up over the weekend and had Seattle locals wondering where the amber-colored haze was originating from , '' Durken said . The fires were started in southeastern Siberia , by farmers burning grass in their fields . But on April 14 , it is believed that the flames quickly grew out of control because of strong winds and spread throughout the region , according to CNN affiliate KOMO-TV . As a result , the fires have destroyed dozens of villages in the region . Rescue crews were able to put out the flames . However , the lingering smoke from the widespread fires were picked up by atmospheric winds . The winds carried the smoke from Siberia across the Pacific Ocean and brought it to the Pacific Northwest . Parts of Oregon , Washington and British Columbia are seeing the results of the smoke , wind and solar light combination . The reason people are seeing an intense red sunset is a result of smoke particles filtering out the shorter wavelength colors from the sunlight like greens , blues , yellows and purples , KOMO-TV said . That means colors like red and orange are able to penetrate the air unfiltered . The colors are especially intense during sunrises and sunsets because there is more atmosphere for the light to travel through to get to a person 's eye .

{"src": "First blood to United after their Under 18s saw off City 1-0 in the 'mini-derby ' . Kits aside , this was probably as far removed from Sunday 's big match as you could imagine . For a start , no less than 13 out of the 22 players on show at kick-off were English . Of those , 10 were Mancunian . Callum Gribbin was the matchwinner for Manchester United with a delightful free-kick Ticket prices ? Entry was free and close to 1,000 gathered on the seats and terraces of Moss Lane for a match that kicked off at 3pm on Saturday with half-and-half scarves nowhere to be seen . Altrincham 's compact 6,000-capacity home may not be Old Trafford , but it does have a proud history of its own . It was certainly a grander stage than a windswept Saturday morning on an outfield at United 's Carrington complex , where Paul McGuinness 's Under 18s usually ply their trade . The young Reds coach wanted to make the experience closer to what his tyros could expect should they make the step up to the seniors . And his side lined up with three at the back and supporting wingbacks in a formation seen more than once this season in the first team . In an even first-half the impressive Marcus Wood , from just down the road in Sale , came closest for City with an audacious chip . United manager Paul McGuinness saw his side claim victory in the 'mini derby ' For the home side towering centre-forward Marcus Rashford , another local lad from whom big things are expected , wasted two decent opportunities when put through . Just before the hour mark England Under 17 star Callum Gribbin made and scored the first . In March , the nifty-footed attacking midfielder went viral when United tweeted a clip of him showing outrageous skills to trick four Aston Villa players . He was at it again here , showing nifty footwork on the edge of the box and drawing a foul . After dusting himself down Gribbin stepped up to curl a delightful free-kick around the wall and beyond blonde Joe Hart-a-like Charlie Albinson in the City goal . Moments later it was almost two when full-back Cameron Borthwick-Jackson 's rasping 25-yard drive struck the angle of the crossbar and post . The same man looked to have gotten away with one when he appeared to clip Buckley in the box before sub Aaron Nemane hit the side-netting as the visitors looked for an equaliser . Dutch winger Javairo Dilrosun curled a free kick onto the roof of the net in stoppage time for City but that was all she wrote . The result leaves United , who have won two of this year 's cross-town clashes , two points behind leaders Middlesbrough with a game in hand . Injury-ravaged City however , have now lost both matches in the Barclays Under 18s Premier League end-of-season play-off series . FA chief Greg Dyke recently bemoaned the lack of first-team opportunities for homegrown talent between the ages of 18 and 21 .

'It 's important to win a match and gain some continuity , ' De Sanctis said . 'The last ( four ) months were tough in terms of results . So to win in front of our fans fills us with pride .

They had gone seven matches since their last home win - a 4-2 victory over Inter Milan on November 30 . Meanwhile , Napoli 's winless streak - home and away - was extended to five matches , and Diego Maradona 's former club remained fifth . Security was tight for Napoli 's first visit to Roma since a fan of the southern club died following a shooting before last season 's Italian Cup final at the Stadio Olimpico . Napoli manager Rafa Benitez shows the strain after his side failed to win for the fifth straight game Roma keeper Morgan de Sanctis ( right ) was excellent to deny the visitors and protect the three points Residents of the entire Campania region that includes Naples were barred from buying tickets for the match and 1,000 police officers were called in to maintain order . But there were no reports of problems . Roma was without injured captain Francesco Totti and fellow forward Gervinho but Pjanic quickly made an impact with a free kick from 30 meters that sailed just wide of the post . A few minutes later , Juan Iturbe rapidly carried into the area and passed to Alessandro Florenzi , who from the right flank picked out Pjanic to slot it in . Roma full back Jose Holebas tracks Napoli midfielder Jose Callejon as Roma finally won at home Iburte skips past Miguel Britoss during a vital win for Roma , who have fallen off the pace recently Napoli may have had a case for a penalty when Kostas Manolas stopped Jonathan De Guzman in the 39th with shoulder contact but there was n't much of a protest to referee Nicola Rizzoli , who officiated last year 's World Cup final . In the second half , De Sanctis was superb in denying Dries Mertens on several occasions . The 38-year-old goalkeeper also made a leaping save on a shot from Manolo Gabbiadini in the 64th .

The fish begins relaxing in the man 's hand and stays very still as the owner begins to stroke it with his finger The fish initially moves away before swimming in a full circle and returning to rest in between the man â€™ s fingers . The man then begins massaging the pet by running his finger along it and the fish stays completely still as if enjoying the sensation .

The video concludes with the man removing his hand from the tank and the fish , clearly saddened by this , following it up to the surface of the water . According to Mr Giroux , who uploads many videos of his fish to his Youtube channel , the blood parrot cichlid used to share its tank with two other fish . The fish swims away from the man 's hand a few times in the video but returns to be massaged But he was forced to remove the other two from the tank when he noticed that they were bullying his prized pet . He then set about interacting with the fish by feeding it frozen blood worms by hand and eventually he noticed it becoming more sociable . After a while the fish enjoyed being stroked and Mr Giroux noted that it would become frustrated if he didn â€™ t play with it on a daily basis . The fish begins swimming around the man 's fingers and towards the surface as he removes his hand The man massages and plays with his fish for at least 15 minutes each day .

{"src": "Football Association chairman Greg Dyke has been handed the backing of five former England managers as he bids to push through radical changes . Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12 , however he is facing opposition from the Premier League . The proposals also include changing the rules so that 'home-grown ' means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21 . FA chairman Greg Dyke ( left ) , speaking with Premier League chief Richard Scudamore , wants to increase the number of homegrown players at top flight clubs Graham Taylor , Glenn Hoddle , Kevin Keegan , Sven-Goran Eriksson and Steve McClaren have signed a letter addressed to Dyke , the Daily Telegraph reports .

The managers add : 'There are many reasons why England has failed to win any major honours since 1966 and each of us bears a portion of that responsibility . 'However , as the England Commission 's evidence has demonstrated , the pool of English talent playing at the very top level is shrinking and it 's an undeniable fact that this is a clear disadvantage for any England manager . ' The rise of Harry Kane ( centre ) proves that England can bring through talented youngsters A draw for England in Italy on Tuesday was a respectable result , and Roy Hodgson 's team have encountered no trouble in their Euro 2016 qualifying group to date , winning all five of their matches . There are signs of encouragement with the emergence of a new generation of young players , the former England bosses reason .

{"src": "( CNN ) A North Pacific gray whale has earned a spot in the record books after completing the longest migration of a mammal ever recorded . The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays .

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl . A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls .

By mid-June there were more than half a million passports stuck in the system . Ministers agreed to give urgent cases a free upgrade to the fast-track service , but thousands had already paid the extra Â£30 per passport for this . Many still missed trips because their passports did not arrive in time .
